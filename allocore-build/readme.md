Allocore Binary
===============

This is a built instance of allocore (which is a part of [allosystem](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/AlloSystem)). Since allosystem doesn't provide a convenient way to build and use its submodules, I've copied the built library and it's include folder so that it can be used as a submodule for other projects. 

There are also two simple scripts named `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` that copy/remove these files into their respective /usr/local directory.
